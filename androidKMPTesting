Based on the provided High-Level Design (HLD) document, there are three main preference plugins in the caching system:

1. Preference Plugin:
   - Purpose: Store unsecured information like user preferences, flags, and application configurations.
   - Implementation: Uses a KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform) library to provide a common datasource mechanism for Android and iOS.
   - Data Storage: Saved in the KMP layer using DataStore.
   - Key Features:
     - Returns data based on key to the calling Data Module.
     - Data is pulled from KMP DataStore.
     - Can clear all preferences or a specific preference key.
     - Performs put/get operations on a background thread.

2. Encrypted Preference Plugin:
   - Purpose: Store secure information that requires encryption.
   - Implementation: Application plugin requiring native configuration.
   - Data Storage: Saved in the Native layer.
   - Key Features:
     - Returns data based on key to the calling Data Module.
     - Data is pulled from the Native App.
     - On iOS, stores data in Secure Enclave.
     - On Android, uses Encrypted Preferences.
     - Decryption is done on the native platform.
     - Supports clearing all stored preferences.

3. Biometrics (Locked) Preference Plugin:
   - Purpose: Store secure information that requires biometric authentication, such as biometrics login and account-specific configurations.
   - Implementation: Application plugin requiring native configuration.
   - Data Storage: Saved in the Native layer (keychain/keystore).
   - Key Features:
     - Returns data based on key to the calling Data Module.
     - Data is pulled from the Native App.
     - Requires biometric authentication before accessing data.
     - Supports clearing all keychain/keystore data.
     - Performs put/get operations on a background thread, with biometric prompts triggered from background and moved to foreground.
     - Invalidates current stores when biometrics/TouchID/FaceID changes.

Each plugin serves a specific purpose in the caching system, providing different levels of security and functionality for storing preferences in a Kotlin Multiplatform project.

Based on your requirements and the provided code, here's a detailed Low-Level Design (LLD) document for your Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project. This document focuses on the preference caching system, including the use of Koin for dependency injection and testing with a Compose app.

## Low-Level Design Document

### Overview

This document provides a detailed low-level design for the preference caching system in a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project. The system consists of three main plugins: regular, encrypted, and biometrics-locked preferences. The actual implementation for encryption and biometrics is assumed to be handled on the native Android and iOS platforms.

### Components

1. **Preference Plugins**
   - Regular Preference Plugin
   - Encrypted Preference Plugin
   - Biometrics Preference Plugin

2. **Data Storage**
   - DataStore for Regular Preferences
   - Platform-Specific Storage for Encrypted and Biometrics Preferences

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Koin for Dependency Management

4. **Testing and Integration**
   - Compose App for Testing
   - KMP Repository Communication

### Detailed Design

#### 1. Preference Plugins

- **PreferencePluginInterface**
  - **Methods**:
    - `getPreference(key: String, default: String): String`
    - `putPreference(key: String, value: String)`
    - `hasPreference(key: String): Boolean`
    - `clearPreference(key: String)`

- **EncryptedPreferencePluginInterface**
  - **Methods**: Same as `PreferencePluginInterface`

- **BiometricsPreferencePluginInterface**
  - **Methods**: Same as `PreferencePluginInterface`

#### 2. Data Storage

- **DataStore (Common)**
  - **Purpose**: Store regular preferences using `DataStore<Preferences>`.
  - **Path Configuration**: Path is provided by platform-specific implementations.

- **Platform-Specific Storage**
  - **Android**: The actual implementation for encrypted and biometrics preferences is assumed to be handled using Android's native capabilities.
  - **iOS**: The actual implementation for encrypted and biometrics preferences is assumed to be handled using iOS's native capabilities.

#### 3. Dependency Injection with Koin

- **Koin Setup**
  - **Common Module**: Provides interfaces for preference plugins.
  - **Platform Modules**: Provide platform-specific implementations.

```kotlin
// Common Module
import org.koin.core.module.Module
import org.koin.dsl.module

fun getCommonModule(): Module {
    return module {
        single<PreferencePluginInterface> { PreferencePlugin(get()) }
        single<EncryptedPreferencePluginInterface> { EncryptedPreferencePlugin(get()) }
        single<BiometricsPreferencePluginInterface> { BiometricsPreferencePlugin(get()) }
    }
}

expect fun getPlatformDataStore(): DataStore<Preferences>
```

- **Android Module**:
  ```kotlin
  actual fun getPlatformDataStore(): DataStore<Preferences> {
      // Assume the path is provided by the native Android app
      return createDataStore { context.filesDir.resolve("preferences.pb").absolutePath }
  }
  ```

- **iOS Module**:
  ```kotlin
  actual fun getPlatformDataStore(): DataStore<Preferences> {
      // Assume the path is provided by the native iOS app
      val documentDirectory = NSFileManager.defaultManager.URLForDirectory(
          directory = NSDocumentDirectory,
          inDomain = NSUserDomainMask,
          appropriateForURL = null,
          create = false,
          error = null
      )
      return createDataStore { requireNotNull(documentDirectory).path + "/preferences.pb" }
  }
  ```

#### 4. Testing and Integration

- **Compose App Integration**
  - **Purpose**: Test communication between KMP and native layers.
  - **Setup**: Use the Compose app to interact with KMP preferences and verify functionality.

- **Koin Integration in Compose App**
  - **Initialization**: Set up Koin in the Compose app to inject dependencies from the KMP module.
  - **Communication**: Test preference retrieval and storage through the Compose UI.

```kotlin
class MainApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        startKoin {
            androidContext(this@MainApplication)
            modules(getCommonModule())
        }
    }
}
```

### Component Interactions

1. **Preference Retrieval and Storage**
   - Regular preferences are accessed via the `PreferencePlugin`.
   - Encrypted and biometrics preferences use platform-specific implementations.

2. **Data Flow**
   - Data is retrieved from the KMP layer and stored in platform-specific secure storage for encrypted and biometrics preferences.

3. **Testing with Compose**
   - Use the Compose app to test the integration of KMP preferences with native storage solutions.

### Conclusion

This LLD provides a comprehensive view of the preference caching system, focusing on the implementation of regular, encrypted, and biometrics-locked preferences in a KMP project. It details the interactions between components, the use of platform-specific features for secure data storage, and the integration of Koin for dependency management. The Compose app serves as a testing ground for verifying communication between the KMP and native layers, with the actual encryption and biometrics logic implemented natively on Android and iOS.
